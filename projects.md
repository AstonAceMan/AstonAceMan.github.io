## Projects

#### Here are some projects I have worked on which have been un-privatised since their creation. Please note that although these projects are in the public domain, various licences held by the client may still be in effect. It is recommended that you do not directly duplicate works for copyright reasons.

Just a funny site I made to joke around with friends about being a 'Russian Hacker'. Not secure or practical in any sense but has a few neat visual features. There's no backend so feel free to dig around in the F12 inspector.

### I've done a lot more
I've done plenty of development outside of these few projects. Feel free to send me a message through Discord if you are interested in my skillset to get a quote, or if you just need someone to help out on a small bug fix.
