## Roblox Admin Panel
The Roblox Admin Panel is a system for moderating players in Roblox games. This was a commission so some details may be limited such as source code but screenshots and documentation is available to the public and is shown here.

### How it Works
The system uses Lua, Roblox's default programming language. It consists of Database storage, search algorithms, server-client communication, User Interfaces (GUIs) and much more. It allows administrators of Roblox games to mute, warn, kick, ban, etc players. There is a full permission system built into the system with a custom console for debugging and for more advanced moderation actions. The whole project was coded and designed my me with design input from the client.

### Conclusion
This was a fairly advanced project which took about a month to develop from scratch. It should be noted that the back-end of this system was in my opinion the more impressive part but for obvious reasons I unfortunately can't display this here. Because of this, it is not available on GitHub, but you can take a look at the full console documentation for moderators which I also coded entirely from scratch with HTML, JS, CSS: [![ok then](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Documentation-red?logo=cliqz)](http://docs.unaux.com)
