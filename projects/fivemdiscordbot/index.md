## FiveM Discord Bot
The FiveM Discord Bot is a Discord bot which shows a playerlist and status for FiveM Servers.

### How it Works
The bot runs off of a privately-hosted server and is build on a [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)  framework running, you guessed it, Javascript.

### Commands
`-status` or `-s` for short returns the full playerlist for the server. It also displays a link called connect which connects you to the server through a browser opening the FiveM application. Here you can see the command being used to check the playerlist of [TXDPS-RP](https://txdps-rp.com/):

`-id <player id>` can be used to get the status of individual players on the server. Information includes the Ping in milliseconds between the player and the server, and any linked profiles the user may have such as the Steam profile in the following example:

### Conclusion
Although this was a fairly simple project, it is a useful one that I continue to use to this day. This repo is not available to the public yet, but may become public in the near future.
