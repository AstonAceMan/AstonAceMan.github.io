## FiveM CAD MDT
Computer Aided Dispatch Mobile Data Terminal systems are common on FiveM roleplay servers such as on this client's server. They requested a custom system which wasn't just a variant of an opensource solution. They also requested for a maximum amount of realism with the system in accordance to Australia's New South Wales' Police CAD System. It also had to have real-time connection and communication with the game server itself. 

### How it Works
The cad system is 100% built from scratch using a C# WinForms .NET Framework on Visual Studio. This means the final product is a standalone executable (.exe) file which is convenient to download and use. The 'backend' is just the FiveM server itself running a HTTP Service and broadcasting information to the Mobile Data Terminals over a REST API. Likewise, POST requests can be made on the MDT to change data on the server side. All of these functions have appropriate session management and authentication to ensure only authorised clients can perform certain actions.

### Conclusion
This project is a work-in-progress and therefore a lot of the information regarding it is confidential. Aside from this I can say this is a fairly ambitious project which is turning out well.
