## Russian Hacking Joke
Ok, so a bit of a weird one. This was a silly project I worked on to develop my skills in the HTML, JS, CSS region of programming. It basically consists of a login page, and if you get the correct code, another page with a bunch of random stuff on it (most of which is meaningless). It is modelled on what my idea of a KGB terminal was, just an old greenscreen terminal screen with choppy characters and slow write speeds.

### How it Works
Pretty simple stuff. It is all client-side JS, so a not-very-secure 'code' which is just `soyuz`. It was a fun little project to get the scrolling text, and text effects working along with a bit of client-side Javascript. Not my proudest of works, but it helped me develop some key skills in the web-development area.
